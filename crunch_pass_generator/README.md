# Macchanger Usage Guide

Macchanger is a tool for changing the MAC address of your network interface. This guide provides basic commands for using Macchanger to manage MAC addresses effectively.

## Overview

MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces. Changing the MAC address can help enhance privacy and security, and Macchanger simplifies this process.

## Basic Commands

### 1. List Available Interfaces

Use the following command to list available network interfaces:

```bash
macchanger -l
```
2. View Current MAC Address

To view the current MAC address of a specific interface, use:

```bash

macchanger -s <interface>
```
Replace <interface> with the name of the network interface (e.g., wlan0, eth0).

### 3. Change MAC Address
Change to a Random MAC Address:

```bash

sudo macchanger -r <interface>
```
Change to a Specific MAC Address:

```bash

sudo macchanger -m <new_mac_address> <interface>
```
Replace <new_mac_address> with the MAC address you want to set, and <interface> with the name of the network interface.

### 4. Restore Original MAC Address

To restore the original MAC address of an interface, use:

```bash

sudo macchanger -p <interface>

```

### 5. Set MAC Address on Boot

To set a specific MAC address to be used every time the system boots, use:

```bash

sudo macchanger --permanent <interface>

```

This will modify the configuration file for the network interface to use the specified MAC address on every boot.

Remember to replace <interface> with the name of your network interface (e.g., wlan0, eth0). Additionally, you may need to run these commands with sudo to have the necessary permissions to modify network interfaces.
### Note

Always use Macchanger responsibly and ensure that you have permission to change the MAC address of the network interface you're working with.
